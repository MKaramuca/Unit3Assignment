Research Input data: go to http://www.weather.com

Pick two cities of your choice. Fill in the temperature for the 7 days of this week of both cities. Fill in this text data table, which will be used in your program.

//City_One = 1, City_Two = 2  Replace City_One and City_Two with the names of your cities

//Data Table

   /*For up to 5 Points Extra Credit

      Expand this program:

      1. Create a one dimensional array, cityOne[7] to store the 7 temperatures of city 1, assume that value 0 represents day 1, 1 represents day 2....

      2. Create a one dimensional array, cityTwo[7] to store the 7 temperatures of city 2 , assume that value 0 represents day 1, 1 represents day 2....

      3. Using a for loop (or nested for loop), feed the data of CityOne[] and CityTwo[] into temperature[i][j], where i is index of the City Number, and j is the index of the temp for the day.

      4. print the results of temperature[i][j]; to the screen.
